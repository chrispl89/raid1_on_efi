# Redundant EFI with RAID1 – No More Downtime

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to setting up a **RAID1 array for the EFI system partition**. The goal is to increase system resilience and avoid downtime in case one disk fails — especially important for critical systems, servers, and high-availability environments.

## Why use RAID1 for EFI?

- ✅ Boot protection: If one disk fails, the system can still boot from the second.
- ✅ Avoid downtime: No need for emergency rescue operations just to reinstall the bootloader.
- ✅ Peace of mind: Redundancy at every level, including your boot infrastructure.

> Note: Not all systems support EFI on RAID. Test thoroughly before using in production!
